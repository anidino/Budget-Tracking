# Budget Tracking PWA

## Description 
This Express application allows users to add both deposits and expenses, whether or not they have internet connection. Using IndexedDB, the user is able to add to their budget or add to their expenses (subtracting from the budget). 

## User Story
- `AS AN avid traveler`
- `I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection`
- `SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling`

## Acceptance Criteria
- `GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection`
- `WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit`
- `THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit`
- `WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection`
- `THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated`
